# Answer sheet for questions 1 to 4

On this page, you can see the answers to the first four questions from the first series of Shahid Beheshti University's Big Data course assignments. I have answered these assignments in a notebook. But for convenience, a series of attached files should also be placed near the notebook. The following links will facilitate your access to the files.
